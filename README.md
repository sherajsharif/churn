## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ChurnGuard
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Model Details

The application uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer churn. The model:
- Automatically handles missing values
- Performs feature scaling
- Encodes categorical variables
- Provides feature importance analysis
- Shows model performance metrics
